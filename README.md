# The Commodities of Devshells

Behold, an assemblage of Nix devshells, artfully wrought for the purposes of development and various other general applications.

## The Array of Devshells

In the present hour, the following devshells have been duly fashioned for your perusal:

- `rvc-webui`: An illustrious devshell tailored for the [rvc](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) webui enterprise. It affords the distinguished privilege of executing the `run.sh` script, thereby setting the webui into operation, a task rendered as facile as a gentle zephyr's caress.

## The Art of Packages

The following packages have been artfully crafted for your perusal:

- `openalpr`: A package for the [OpenALPR](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr) project, which provides automatic license plate recognition. (Btw, IT DOES NOT WORK ON MACOS, but I have no idea why. It works on Linux, though. But in macOS the process is just killed without any error message.)
